    <h2 class="secheading"> FAST AND FURIOUS</h2>
<p class="text">Fast & Furious (also known as The Fast and the Furious) is a media franchise centered on a series of action films that are largely concerned with family, heists, spies, and street racing. The franchise also includes short films, a television series, toys, video games, live shows, and theme park attractions.</p>

    <p>
        The first film was released in 2001, which began the original tetralogy of films focused on illegal street racing and culminated in the film Fast & Furious (2009). The series transitioned towards heists and spying with Fast Five (2011) and was followed by five sequels, with the most recent, Fast X, set for release in May 2023. The main films are known as The Fast Saga.

    <p>Dominic "Dom" Toretto is a fictional character and one of the two main protagonists of the Fast & Furious franchise. He is portrayed by Vin Diesel and first appeared on film with fellow protagonist Brian O'Conner in The Fast and the Furious (2001). Dominic was created by screenwriter Gary Scott Thompson, who was inspired by an article on street racing that was published in the May 1998 issue of Vibe magazine, while Diesel was heavily sought after to play the character.[2]</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>As the patriarch of a group of street racers, Dom acts as an influential voice, being forced into the role as primary caregiver following his father's untimely passing. As the leader, he initially worked as an auto mechanic, but eventually progressed to orchestrating carjackings, a multi-million dollar heist, and illicit jobs for government agencies.

    Dominic is gruff, strong, and possesses a volatile temper, especially when his family is in danger. He preaches morality and loyalty, and in many cases is also seen to be affectionate and religious. He is married to Letty Ortiz, with whom he raises a son.[3] He is also implied to be the group's strongest and most skilled racer, a title that is challenged persistently by Brian.</p>

    <button class="sec" onclick="window.location.href='https://youtube.com/shorts/T8bS_KCj61I?feature=share';">HAN</button>
    <p>Living in Tokyo, Han uses his new-found wealth to start his own garage, as well as purchasing various expensive, modified tuner cars to store in the garage. Han also keeps himself occupied with various women, with a club attached next door to his garage. Additionally, he becomes involved with Tokyo's elite street racers and one of its most prominent drifters. At some point, he acquired a 2001 Nissan Silvia S15 Spec-S and rebuilt and restored it from the ground up, the car later being referred to by Twinkie as the Mona Lisa of the Drifting world.

        Han also affiliates himself with Takashi, the nephew of Kamata, a Yakuza boss, securing profits from various business ventures. Unbeknownst to either Kamata and Takashi, Han begins stealing money from their operation and does so without either of them noticing for some time.
        
        When Han meets Sean Boswell, Boswell crossed Takashi's unspoken boundaries by speaking to his girlfriend, Neela. Han questions why Takashi is still bothering with “high school girls” when Takashi decides to confront Sean. When Sean accepts Takashi's challenge to drift, Han gives Sean the keys to his Nissan Silvia, curious to see what Sean is made of.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>He merely states that the "side deals" he made while under the protection of Takashi's word were in the nature of their business. He goes on to say that Takashi needed him and that he would’ve amounted to nothing if it wasn't for his help. When Takashi becomes distracted by the presence of Neela, Han takes his chance and climbs into his car and escapes.</p>
